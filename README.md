in the command line type 'node liri.js spotify-this-song Ace of Spades' (you can enter any song, does not need to be ace of spades).
this will pull up the song name, artist, album and a link to the song.

in the command line type 'node liri.js concert-this Muse' (you can enter any band, does not need to be Muse).
this will pull up the next concert available by this band, the venue name they will be playing, and the city/country they will be playing.

in the command line type 'node liri.js movie-this Inception' (you can enter any movie, does not need to be Inception).
this will pull up the movie title, year it was made, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes rating, Country and language origin, actors and the plot of the movie. 

in the command line type 'node liri.js do-what-it-says' and it will auto generate "i want it this way" by backstreet boys.
